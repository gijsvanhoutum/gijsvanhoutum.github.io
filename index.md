## About me

---

Hi there!

I am Gijs van Houtum, a passionate computer vision software engineer/applied scientist. 
I love to write software, develop new algorithms, create awesome machine learning solutions but above all, 
I like to make stuff work. 

In the last 7+ years I have helped over 5 different companies with newly developed computer vision solutions.
My work has predominately been focused towards creating smart deep learning based computer vision algorithms 
for the manufacturing industry. Quality monitoring has been the main task of these algorithms I built.
The main goal is to help and push the manufacturing industry to Industry 5.0 eventually, using these smart solutions! 

I am also pursueing a PhD in industrial AI (finished Mar-2024). During my work, I noticed the demand for smart 
solutions based on machine learning within the manufacturing industry, and specifically the Metal Additive Manufacturing 
Industry. Recurring problems from company to company created a personal vision and interest in the creation of 
data-efficient machine learning solutions. Practical experience with AI has taught me the importance of qualitative datasets
used for training as well as validation. Creating them is however time consuming, difficult and expensive. My PhD is 
therefore focused on creating awesome solutions that require less data to be annotated, and adaptive machine learning models, 
that are task invariant.

In my spare time I love to write software and restore old motorcycles/cars with my dad. 
During holidays I like to explore, hike, ski or sail the seas.

Some of my public projects are listed below! Please take a look at them. Some include code, 
which is hosted on Github, others are not. All code related to work is confidential, 
therefore I am not able to share any of that. None of these projects are forked,
so only orignal stuff!

Have fun!
