## About me

---

Hi there!

I am Gijs van Houtum, a passionate computer vision software engineer/applied scientist. 
I love to write software, develop new algorithms and create awesome machine learning solutions. 
Above all, I just love to make stuff work!

In the last 7+ years I have helped over 5 different companies with newly developed computer vision solutions.
My work has predominately been focused towards creating smart deep learning based computer vision algorithms 
for the manufacturing industry. Quality monitoring has been the main task of these algorithms I built.
The main goal is to help and push the manufacturing industry to Industry 5.0 eventually, using these smart solutions! 

I am also pursueing a PhD in industrial AI (finished Mar-2024). During my work, I noticed the demand for smart 
solutions based on machine learning within the manufacturing industry, and specifically the Metal Additive Manufacturing 
Industry. Recurring problems from company to company created a personal vision and interest in the creation of 
data-efficient machine learning solutions. Practical experience with AI has taught me the importance of qualitative datasets
used for training as well as validation. Creating them is however time consuming, difficult and expensive. My PhD is 
therefore focused on creating awesome solutions that require less data to be annotated, and adaptive machine learning models, 
that are task invariant.

In my spare time I love to write software and restore old motorcycles/cars with my dad. 
During holidays I like to explore, hike, ski or sail the seas.

Some of my public projects are listed below! Please take a look at them. Some include code, 
which is hosted on Github, others are not. All code related to work is confidential, 
therefore I am not able to share any of that. None of these projects are forked,
so only orignal stuff!

Have fun!

### (2016) Vision-based Deposition Geometry Detection

Using a camera and a line laser to detect the geometry of 3D printing deposition
geometries. In a period of 3.5 Months I created computer vision software, algorithms and a
[report](https://github.com/gijsvanhoutum/2016_internship_msam/blob/master/report/0872274-VisionBasedDepositionGeometryDetection.pdf). 
Hardware selection (Camera,Line Laser), CAD bracket modelling and 3D printing as well as experiments were 
all parts I created myself.

During this specific project there was a need for a fast video recording application that could talk with the
DinoLite Edge camera. Since I could not find one, I decided to write one myself, **TREC**. It is often hard to 
see what computer vision algorithms do when you change certain parameters. I therefore created another 
application named **ALAN** that could visualize and run camera footage alongside different 
computer vision algorithms in real-time as well as use pre-recorded videos.

[TREC: Threaded Video Player and Recorder](https://github.com/gijsvanhoutum/trec)

**TREC** is a GUI application for video recording and playing. This application is especially 
interesting for new camera devices if they are supported by Video4Linux, including devices as
DinoLite Edge.
