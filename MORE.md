# A little more about me

My personal page and resume cover some stuff, but not all of it. Most people 
wonder where I live as there is a mixture of Dutch and Canadian locations 
accross my resume. I am Dutch but have been living in Canada for most of the last
7 years. During that time I have worked for different companies, some of which 
were in the Netherlands. So how does this all fit together?

Although I had a life before they year 2016 I start there as that was the year
I went abroad. I ended up in Waterloo, Canada at the [Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing Lab](https://msam.uwaterloo.ca/). 
This laboratory is one of the largest academic 3D printing facilities in the 
world and provides access and exposure to most 3D printing technologies as well 
as plenty of measurement machinery. Think of CT scanning, Ultrasound, Structured-light,
Stereo Vision, Microscopy, High speed camera's and the list goes on. 

At that time I was a Control Theory Master's student and my task as an intern was 
to create software with an algorithm that could measure the geometry of deposited 
material during an additive manufacturing process. This project was a collaboration 
between my university in the Netherlands, Eindhoven University of Technology, MSAM,
and a company named Xiris which develops hardware and software for their inhouse 
HDR camera solutions for the welding industry. In the end, I delivered hardware, 
software and the algorithm within 3 Months. Take a look at it [here](https://github.com/gijsvanhoutum/vbgt).
I guess they liked my work, as they offered me a job, which I turned down. 

After that internship, computer vision, and specifically deep learning based 
computer vision, is all wanted to do. The math and education I gained during my 
control theory studies proved to be a good fit for machine learning in general. 
Since my resume does not provide any information regarding coursework I have listed 
a couple below which were conducted during during my Master's and PhD. The list 
is however by no means complete. You can find other curriculum courses [here](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/graduate-school/master-systems-and-control/degree-structure).
