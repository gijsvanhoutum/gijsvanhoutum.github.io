# Hi 1X!

I have known for a while that at some point I needed to show a bit more of myself 
in terms of personal information as well as projects on Github to the world. 
Working and completing a PhD in my spare time has however kept me from it. 

This is my new, long overdue, webpage I created in response to your opportunity. 
This specific page is made for you and can only be accesed if you know the URL. 
So keep that in mind when you start exploring this webpage. I hope you like it!

Although there is already plenty to explore on this webpage, it is still far from
complete as only a handfull of personal projects were added that I could find and
brush up during this short period. Also, my best work is confidential, which is a
bummer. I therefore try to take it to the next step on this page and provide
more in depth information regarding my studies, work, skills and experiences. 

I am very excited about the opportunity as a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at 1X. 
Therfore I hope my efforts are satisfactory and live up to the provided task at hand. 

## A little more about me

My personal page and resume cover some stuff, but not all of it. Most people 
wonder where I live as there is a mixture of Dutch and Canadian locations 
accross my resume. I am Dutch but have been living in Canada for most of the last
7 years. During that time I have worked for different companies, some of which 
were in the Netherlands. So how does this all fit together?

It started all back in 2016 when I decided to go abroad. I ended up in Waterloo,
Canada at the [Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing Lab](https://msam.uwaterloo.ca/). 
This laboratory is one of the largest academic 3D printing facilities in the 
world and provides access and exposure to most 3D printing technologies as well 
as plenty of measurement machinery. Think of CT scanning, Ultrasound, Structured-light,
Stereo Vision, Microscopy, High speed camera's and the list goes on. 

At that time I was a Control Theory Master's student and my task as an intern was 
to create software with an algorithm that could measure the geometry of deposited 
material during an additive manufacturing process. This project was a collaboration 
between my university in the Netherlands, Eindhoven University of Technology, MSAM,
and a company named Xiris which develops hardware and software for their inhouse 
HDR camera solutions for the welding industry. In the end, I delivered hardware, 
software and the algorithm within 3 Months. Take a look at it [here](https://github.com/gijsvanhoutum/vbgt).
I guess they liked my work, as the CEO of Xiris offered me a job, which I turned down. 

After that internship, computer vision, and specifically deep learning based 
computer vision, is all wanted to do. The math and education I gained during my 
control theory studies proved to be a good fit for machine learning in general. 
Since my resume does not provide any information regarding coursework I have listed 
a couple below which were conducted during during my Master's and PhD. The list 
is however be no means complete. 
- Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
- Advanced Image Processing and Deep Learning
- Advanced Pattern Recognition
- Model reduction
- Nonlinear control
- System Identification
- Mathematical Optimization
- Dyanmic programming
- Optimal Control
- Model Predictive Control
- System Theory for Control
