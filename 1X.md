# Hi 1X!

I have known for a while that at some point I needed to show a bit more of myself 
in terms of personal information as well as projects on Github to the world. 
Working and completing a PhD in my spare time has however kept me from it. 

This is my new, long overdue, webpage I created in response to your opportunity. 
This specific page is made for you and can only be accesed if you know the URL. 
So keep that in mind when you start exploring this webpage. I hope you like it!

Although there is already plenty to explore on this webpage, it is still far from
complete as only a handfull of personal projects were added that I could find and
brush up during this short period. Also, my best work is confidential, which is a
bummer. I therefore try to take it to the next step on this page and provide
more in depth information regarding my studies, work, skills and experiences. 

## Work

Back in 2016, I decided I wanted to go abroad and ended up at the [Multi-Scale 
Additive Manufacturing Lab](https://msam.uwaterloo.ca/) in Waterloo (MSAM), Canada. This laboratory is the biggest
3D printing facility in Canada and has most 3D printing technologies in house. 

My task as an intern was to create software with an algorithm that could measure 
the geometry of deposited material during an additive manufacturing process. This
project was a collaboration between my university in the Netherlands, Eindhoven 
University of Technology, the University of Waterloo and a Industrial camera 
company named Xiris.
