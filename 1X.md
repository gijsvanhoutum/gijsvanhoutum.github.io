# Hi 1X!

I have known for a while that at some point I needed to show a bit more of myself 
in terms of personal information as well as projects on Github to the world. 
Working and completing a PhD in my spare time has however kept me from it. More
personal information can be found [here](/ABOUT).

This is my new, long overdue, webpage I created in response to your opportunity. 
This specific page is made for you and can only be accesed if you know the URL. 
So keep that in mind when you start exploring this webpage. I hope you like it!
The startpage can be found [here](https://gijsvanhoutum.github.io/).

Although there is already plenty to explore on this webpage, it is still far from
complete as only a handfull of personal projects were added that I could find and
brush up during this short period. I therefore try to take it to the next step on 
this page and provide more in depth information regarding some of my work.

I am very excited about the opportunity as a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at 1X. 
Therfore I hope my efforts live up to the provided task at hand. Let's go!

As most of my work is confidential, I added a couple of [papers](/PAPERS) 
and [projects](/PROJECTS) to this website. They are by no means complete nor 
perfect. Although they provide some insights in some small personal coding projects
they do not really represent my work. I thought it would be good to 
describe a specific work project in detail without violating the NDA. 

From 2019 to 2021 I have worked on project bases for a company called Xiris. 
This project covers the investigation, writing and work sample in my opinion. It 
is also a good representation of my work for other companies. The order in which the 
samples are discussed, is however reversed, as any project should start with
an investigation first, followed by documentation, and at last the work itself in 
my opinion.

## Investigation Sample

This project at Xiris started with a specific problem they faced. Xiris makes 
industrial camera's for the manufacturing industry in general, but specifically 
for the welding and additive manufacturing industry. These camera's are expensive
but able to handle heat and bright operating conditions. Besides, hardware, they
make their own software application that allows camera control in terms of shutter
time, region-of-interest and so on. Specific Zeiss optics are used for focusing.
Please check out their website to get a better idea of their offerings [here](https://www.xiris.com/weld-monitoring-cameras/).

Some of their customers ask for specific computer vision algorithms that
detect objects or measure certain area's in the camera field-of-view specific to
their applications. At Xiris, their software stack is pure C++ OpenCV. They build
their own SDK around it and use it create these novel algorithms. For the last 
couple of years they have used the conventional/classical computer vision algorithms
to solve most of their problems. 

Xiris had many customers asking for a tool that could segment the melt-pool in real-time 
such that its geometry could be measured and possible controlled in the future. 
This type of measurement proved to be difficult using conventional approaches. They
essentially tried everything in [this](https://szeliski.org/Book/) computer vision book. 
With this problem they approached me and asked me if I could solve this problem for them
using any of the novel computer vision methods as their own solutions led to errornous
predictions which were leading to bad melt-pool measurements. 

At that point I started with a couple of conversations on-site to discuss the 
following:
- What they had done and tried in the past to solve the problem
- The needs of their customers
- The needs of Xiris itselfs
- Chat with domain experts
    - Welding experts to discuss the process and what should be observed
    - Xiris software engineers about how they deploy algorithms.
- If they had any pre-recorded footage to learn from.

After the task was clear and the priorities were set, I took the time to come up 
with a project planning. No



So after investigating all the have tried and done i.e. watershed etc. I asked them if 
they had pre-recorded
